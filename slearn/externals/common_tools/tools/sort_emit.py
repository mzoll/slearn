    From a list of elements with attributed name and dependency, generate a hierarchy sorted list where
    the dependencies of later emitted elements are met through the previously emitted
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    clist : list of objects
        some list of objects in which each elements has a defined name and dependency to other elements in the list
    attrib_lambda : lambda function
        a function applied to each element of the list returning its name
    deplist : lambda function
        a function applied to each element of the list returning a list of names of other elements that this element itself is dependent of
        
    Returns
    -------
    topologically sorted list where the elements' dependency is met by the previously emitted elements
    
    Example
    -------
    ```
