A clickstream is a simple data stream of fields which are generated on each click, os just imminent information is convened.
For correct attribution of each set of fields to an incrementally build state three identifier fields are most convenient: `UserKey`, `SessionKey`, and an absolute `Time`.
Alternatively the SessionKey can be equally represented by a `NewSession`-Flag.
The `Time`-field is needed to establish time order. Eventually the `Time`-field will be converted into an incremental identifier, which will fulfill the same purpose,
but allows easy tracking across objects.
